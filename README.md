### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm **Eren**, a computer science student and tech enthusiast.

I currently focus on building **web and mobile applications**.

I'm fascinated by **artificial intelligence** and the idea of creating robust, smart and high-impact apps.  
My long-term goal is to contribute to cutting-edge apps that help people in their daily lives.

Outside of coding, I'm interested in technology and otaku culture.
